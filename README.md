# DJS02: Podcast Preview Web Component

## Overview

This project is a responsive podcast web application that uses a custom **Web Component** to render podcast previews.

Each podcast card is implemented as a `<podcast-preview>` element that follows the **Web Components** standard. The component is **stateless**, uses **Shadow DOM** for encapsulated styles and markup, and notifies the main application via a **custom event** when the user interacts with it.

The rest of the app is structured with modular JavaScript, clean separation of concerns, and reusable utilities for data, view models, and modals.

## Core Objectives

### Web Component Functionality

- Create a **custom HTML element** using `customElements.define()`.
- Accept data (cover image, title, genres, number of seasons, and last updated date) **as attributes or properties**.
- Keep the component **stateless** and reliant on external data provided by the parent.
- Use **Shadow DOM** for style and logic encapsulation to avoid global conflicts.
- Trigger a **custom event** when a user interacts with the component (e.g., clicking), so that the parent application can open a modal or take other actions without tightly coupling to the component’s logic.

---

## UI/UX Requirements

- The component should render a clean and **visually consistent preview** of each podcast.
- Display:
  - Podcast **cover image**
  - Podcast **title**
  - **Genre names**
  - **Number of seasons**
  - **Last updated** in a human-readable format
- The component must be **responsive**, and match the overall app design on desktop and mobile.
- On click, the component must notify the parent app to **open a modal** or navigate to details.

---

## Code Quality & Maintainability

- Write clear, consistent, and modular code.
- Follow **functional and object-oriented programming** patterns.
- Document major functions using **JSDoc comments** (parameters, return types, etc.).
- Use consistent **code formatting** across HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

---

## Technical Constraints

- Do **not** use any third-party frameworks for creating the web component.
- Use **native JavaScript (ES6+)**, HTML, and CSS.
- No page reloads or navigation.
- Ensure compatibility with modern browsers.

---

## Deliverables

- A working custom Web Component file (e.g., `PodcastPreview.js`).
- An HTML demo page showcasing the component usage.
- A `README.md` file with:
  - How to use and register the component
  - Instructions for passing data
  - How to listen for interaction events
